# Yoneda embedding
#=
1. Co-Yoneda:
    [C, Set](C(-, a), C(-, b)) ≅ C(a, b)

(x -> a) -> x -> b ≅ a -> b


3. [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) ≅ C(a, b)
    [C, Set](C(a, a), C(a, a)) ≅ C(a, a)
It's just about the natural transformation between the morphism, which is also a morphism.

4. [C, Set](C(-, a), C(-, b)) ≅ C(a, b)
    x ≤ a -> x ≤ b -> a ≤ b
Thus could find the limits, with proper ≤

5. [[C, D], Set](α(c₁, -), α(c₂, -)) ≅ [C, D](c₂, c₁)
nothing but tell the transformation can have their transformations.
