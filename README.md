# Category Theory For Programmers with Julia

Here explorer the [Category Theory For Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) book,
and take a Julia view on it.

There are three parts in the source file directory, and
every julia file is corresponded to one chapter for notes and implementations.
Also in `test/runtests.jl`, there collected some implemented challenges from the book,
which could be tested by running `] test` in julia's repl.
